# BOCS
BOCS (Behaviour-based Object Composition System, pronounced box) is a multi-layered software architectural pattern that involves composing objects out of Behaviours. Each Behaviour then implements interfaces called "Modules". It is built as an alternative to traditional object systems such as ECS for interactive, reactive and emergent games and simulations..
