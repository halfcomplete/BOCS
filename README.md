# BOCS
BOCS (Behaviour-based Object Composition System, pronounced box) is a multi-layered software architectural pattern that involves composing Objects out of Behaviours that implement Module interfaces, built as an alternative to traditional object systems such as ECS for reactive and emergent games.

## Setup
Because BOCS is not a standalone application, if you wish to incorporate into your own projects, you should clone the repository to use it.
