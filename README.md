# BOCS
BOCS (Behaviour-based Object Composition System, pronounced box) is a multi-layered software architectural pattern that involves composing Objects out of Behaviours that implement Module interfaces, built as an alternative to traditional object systems such as ECS for reactive and emergent games.

## Setup
Because BOCS is not a standalone application, you should clone the repository if you wish to incorporate into your own projects.
